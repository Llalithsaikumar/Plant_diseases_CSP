            <p><b>Ascochyta Blight:</b> Fungal disease causes brown, sunken lesions on stems, leaves, and bolls, eventually leading to wilting and stunted growth.
            </p>
            <p><b>Symptoms: </b>During the visit, circular brown lesions with dark centers were observed on the lower leaves of some cotton plants.
            </p>
            <p><b>Prevention: </b>Crop rotation with non-susceptible crops like corn or alfalfa every 3-4 years was recommended as a preventative measure. Additionally, planting certified disease-resistant cotton varieties and maintaining proper field sanitation (removing plant debris after harvest) were discussed.
            </p>
            <p><b>Treatment: </b>As a preventative measure, applying a copper-based fungicide before the first visible symptoms appear was suggested. However, if symptoms are already present, treatment with a strobilurin fungicide might be necessary. The specific fungicide choice and application timing will depend on disease severity and local regulations.
